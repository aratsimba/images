# Development Log — Directory Application

## Overview
A directory application for managing biographical information about persons and companies, with relationship tracking, address auto-suggest, and unified search capabilities.

---

## Session 1 — Project Setup & Requirements Gathering

### Requirements Defined
The user requested a directory application with the following features:
- **Person management**: Track spouse and child relationships; same household members share the same primary address
- **Company management**: Track contact persons associated with companies
- **Address functionality**: Look-up and auto-suggest valid USA addresses
- **Search capability**: Unified search across persons and companies with auto-suggest and auto-fill as users type partial letters

### Development Environment Exploration
- Examined project structure: template directory, workspace directory, and key configuration files
- Identified available dependencies: React 18.2.0, react-router-dom, axios, lodash, framer-motion, recharts, leaflet, three.js, mammoth, pdf-lib, xlsx, papaparse, and `@amzn/quick-pages-runtime-lib`
- Explored the runtime library capabilities:
  - **Page Storage Client**: Private and shared item storage (put, get, list, delete) with table-based organization, key-value storage, optional tagging, pagination, and sorting
  - **AI Client**: Bedrock Claude integration for inference (prompt method, invoke with tools, multi-step tool-use loops)
  - **Additional exports**: QuickSuite client, user client (`getCurrentUser`), download client, dashboard utilities

### Next Steps Planned
- Register AI inference integration for address lookup functionality

---

## Session 2 — Full Application Implementation

### Application Built (Single-File App.tsx)
The complete directory application was implemented with all requested features:

#### Person Management
- Form with fields: first name, last name, email, phone, address, notes
- Spouse selection via dropdown with automatic bidirectional relationship and shared household ID
- Children picker with searchable interface and chip-based display
- Household ID system: all members (spouse, children) automatically share the same primary address
- Address synchronization logic across all household members

#### Company Management
- Form with fields: company name, industry, email, phone, address, notes
- Contact persons picker with searchable interface for multiple person associations

#### AI-Powered Address Auto-Suggest
- Integrated with Claude Haiku model (`anthropic.claude-haiku-4-5-20251001-v1:0`)
- Triggers when user types 3+ characters in street field
- 400ms debounce for API call optimization
- Dropdown with up to 5 suggestions; auto-fills all address fields on selection
- Click-outside handler to close dropdown

#### Unified Search
- Header-mounted search bar filtering both persons and companies simultaneously
- Live dropdown showing up to 10 matching results with type badges (👤 person, 🏢 company)
- Results include contextual info (industry for companies)
- Clicking a result navigates to detail view

#### Detail View
- Comprehensive info display for selected person or company
- Clickable relationship chips (spouse, children, contact persons, household members)
- Household members section for all persons sharing the same household ID
- Edit and delete functionality with back navigation

### Technical Details
- **Storage**: Shared storage, table name `directory-entries`, key-value with JSON serialization, tag-based categorization by entry type
- **UI**: Inline styles, Amazon Ember font, modern color scheme, hover effects, badge system, chip-based relationship display, 2-column grid forms
- **Hooks**: Custom `useDebounce` (400ms), useState, useEffect, useCallback, useRef
- **Integrations Registered**: AI Inference (for address auto-suggest)

## Session 3 — Code Refactoring to Modular Architecture

### Motivation
The single-file App.tsx had grown large and needed to be refactored for maintainability.

### Extracted Modules

| File | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `types.ts` | All interfaces, type aliases, constants, and label arrays |
| `styles.ts` | Colors object and style definitions dictionary |
| `utils.ts` | Pure utility functions: `toE164`, `formatPhoneDisplay`, `ensureOnePrimary`, `getPrimary`, `getEntryName`, `formatAddr`, `useDebounce` hook, `migrateEntry`, `suggestAddresses` |
| `storage.ts` | Storage operations: `saveEntry`, `loadEntry`, `loadAll`, `removeEntry`; CSV helpers: `exportCsv`, `parseCsvFile`, `entryToCsvRow`, `csvRowToEntry` |
| `components/AddressFields.tsx` | Address form fields with AI-powered auto-suggest |
| `components/MultiItemField.tsx` | Reusable multi-item selector with search and chips |
| `components/RelationshipPicker.tsx` | Relationship selection component |
| `components/DuplicateWarning.tsx` | Duplicate entry detection and warning display |
| `components/Toolbar.tsx` | Top toolbar/navigation component |
| `App.tsx` | Streamlined orchestrator: state management, view routing, save/delete handlers, rendering |

### Build Results
- Build succeeded with no errors
- Final bundle: **336.53 kB** (gzip: 99.17 kB), 147 modules transformed
- Build time: ~4.34s (vite build)
- Functionally identical behavior to pre-refactoring state

---

## Session 4 — Log Creation

### Action
- Created this `DEVLOG.md` to capture the full conversation history and development timeline

---

## Session 5 — Delete Confirmation Dialog

### Action
- Added a confirmation prompt before deleting a person or company

### Changes
- **Styles** (`styles.ts`): Added `overlay`, `dialog`, `dialogTitle`, `dialogBody`, and `dialogActions` styles for the modal UI
- **State Management** (`App.tsx`): Added `deleteTarget` state variable to track the entry pending deletion
- **Delete Flow Refactoring** (`App.tsx`):
  - Renamed `handleDelete` to `confirmDelete` — executes actual deletion
  - Created `requestDelete` — sets the `deleteTarget` to show the confirmation dialog
  - Created `cancelDelete` — clears `deleteTarget` to dismiss the dialog
  - Updated the Delete button in detail view to call `requestDelete` instead of directly deleting
- **Dialog Component** (`App.tsx`):
  - Displays when `deleteTarget` is not null
  - Shows entity type (Person/Company) and name
  - Warns about cascading effects: if deleting a person with a spouse, mentions unlinking the spouse by name
  - Includes "This action cannot be undone" warning
  - Provides Cancel and Delete buttons
  - Click-outside-to-close with `stopPropagation` on dialog content

---

## Session 6 — Spouse Picker UX Refinement

### Action
- Ineligible persons (those already married to someone else or listed as children) are now hidden entirely from the spouse picker dropdown, rather than being displayed greyed out with explanatory reasons

### Changes
- Removed `getIneligibleReason()` function
- Removed `ineligible` array and its greyed-out rendering
- Dropdown now shows only filtered eligible candidates (up to 8 results)
- "No matching persons" message triggers when no eligible matches exist

---

## Session 7 — Cascading Delete Cleanup & Household Member Removal

### Part 1: Enhanced Delete with Full Cascading Cleanup
When deleting a person, the `confirmDelete` function now performs a complete relationship cleanup:
- **Spouse unlinking** (existing): Clears the deleted person's ID from their spouse's `spouseId`
- **Parent→child cleanup** (new): Removes the deleted person's ID from all parents' `childIds` arrays
- **Company→contact cleanup** (new): Removes the deleted person's ID from all companies' `contactPersonIds` arrays

The delete confirmation dialog now dynamically computes and displays a bulleted list of all side effects:
- "Unlink spouse **Jane Doe**"
- "Remove as child from **John Doe**, **Jane Doe**"
- "Remove as contact from **Acme Corp**"

### Part 2: Allow Removing Spouse & Children from Household
Previously, spouse and children were "auto" household members without remove buttons. Now all members can be removed.

#### Changes to `HouseholdPicker.tsx`
- Added new callback props: `onRemoveSpouse` and `onRemoveChild(id)`
- Every household member chip now shows a **×** remove button — not just manually-added extras
- Clicking **×** on a spouse chip calls `onRemoveSpouse` (clears spouse relationship)
- Clicking **×** on a child chip calls `onRemoveChild(id)` (removes child from parent-child relationship)
- Updated helper text: *"Spouse and children are automatically included but can be removed."*

#### Changes to `App.tsx`
- Wired `onRemoveSpouse` → sets `pSpouseId` to `''`
- Wired `onRemoveChild` → filters the removed child out of `pChildIds`
- Changes take effect when the user clicks **Save Person**

## Registered Integrations
- **AI Inference** (`ai-inference`): Used for address auto-suggest functionality (Claude Haiku model)

---

## Session 8 — Export Fixes

### Part 1: Log Export Fix
The **📄 Export Log** button was downloading a hardcoded 5-line stub instead of the actual `DEVLOG.md`. Fixed by importing `DEVLOG.md` via Vite's `?raw` suffix and using the imported content in `handleDownloadMarkdown`.

### Part 2: Code Export Fix
The **💾 Export Code** button was only exporting `App.tsx` — a single file out of the 12-file modular codebase. Fixed by:
- Adding `?raw` imports for all source files: `types.ts`, `styles.ts`, `utils.ts`, `storage.ts`, and all 7 component files
- Generating a self-extracting shell script (`directory-app.sh`) that recreates the full project structure
- Running `bash directory-app.sh` creates a `directory-app/` folder with `src/`, `src/components/`, and all 13 files in their correct paths
- Also includes `DEVLOG.md` in the export

---

## Session 9 — Standalone Deployment Discussion

### Question
The user asked whether the app can be deployed to their own AWS cloud infrastructure.

### Answer
The app **cannot** be directly deployed standalone because it depends on Quick Suite runtime services:
- Sandboxed iframe with strict CSP (`default-src 'none'`)
- `window.bridge` communication layer provided by the QuickSight runtime
- `@amzn/quick-pages-runtime-lib` for storage, AI inference, user identity, and file downloads

### Migration Guide Provided
A comprehensive step-by-step rewrite plan was documented for migrating to a standalone deployment:

#### Phase 1: Project Setup
- Create a new React + TypeScript project (Vite, CRA, or Next.js)
- Copy over component files, styles, and types (standard React code is reusable)

#### Phase 2: Replace Quick Suite Runtime Services
| Quick Suite Feature | Standalone Replacement |
|---|---|
| `putSharedItem` / `getSharedItem` / `listSharedItems` / `deleteSharedItem` | DynamoDB or RDS + API Gateway + Lambda |
| `getCurrentUser()` | Amazon Cognito / Auth0 / Firebase Auth |
| `aiClient.prompt()` / `aiClient.invoke()` | Amazon Bedrock Converse API (via backend proxy) |
| Action Connectors | Direct third-party API integration |
| Dashboard Placeholders | QuickSight Embedding SDK |
| `downloadFile()` | `URL.createObjectURL()` + anchor element / FileSaver.js |

#### Phase 3: Remove Sandbox Constraints
- Remove CSP restrictions (can load external resources freely)
- Use standard HTML `<form>` elements
- Use standard external links without bridge workarounds

#### Phase 4: Build & Test
- Remove all `@amzn/quick-pages-runtime-lib` imports
- Create service abstraction layers (`storageService.ts`, `authService.ts`, `aiService.ts`)
- Test CRUD, auth flows, data persistence, and AI features end-to-end

#### Phase 5: Deploy
Hosting options presented:
| Option | Frontend | Backend | Best For |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| AWS Amplify | Amplify Hosting | Amplify Functions / AppSync | Fastest all-in-one AWS setup |
| S3 + CloudFront | S3 static hosting | API Gateway + Lambda | Cost-effective, serverless |
| Vercel / Netlify | Managed hosting | Serverless functions | Simplicity, fast iteration |
| ECS / EC2 | Containerized or VM | Same container/VM | Full control |

Additional deployment considerations: CI/CD pipeline, custom domain with Route 53 + ACM SSL, and monitoring (CloudWatch / Sentry / Datadog).
